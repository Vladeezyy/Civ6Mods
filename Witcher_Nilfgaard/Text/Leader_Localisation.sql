This caused an uproar and the queen''s vassals and the would-be suitors tried to attack Duny, with Geralt and Mousesack trying to protect Duny.

	'In the 1250s, after Ciri''s birth, the sorcerer Vilgefortz appeared before Duny at Cintra as an ally, wanting to acquire wealth and power only the Nilfgaardian Imperator could provide. When Vilgefortz disclosed with him the prophecy, Duny decided to return to Nilfgaard to reclaim his heritage with Ciri in tow. However, under the watchful eye of Calanthe, Duny and Vilgefortz thought of a ploy to disappear without a trace by faking Pavetta''s, Ciri''s, and his own death on a sinking ship while Vilgefortz secretly prepared a way for them to survive. However Pavetta, aware of her husband''s plans, smuggled Ciri out of the ship in time, leading to a scuffle between Pavetta and Duny as the former was pushed overboard and drowned at sea. Vilgefortz then teleported the ship from a raging maelstrom with Duny being the only survivor. Though distraught from inadvertently murdering his wife, and despite not holding genuine feelings towards her, Emhyr was successful in faking his death as "Duny" and was able to return to his homeland and lead a revolt against the Usurper. One of the first things he did was that he rewarded Xarthisius with a tower in the capital city for his aforementioned services.'),
