The remaining army had about 6,000 men left. 1,200 soldiers and knights were beaten in Aldersberg.

Until the 12th century Rivia became one of two major powers in the region. In 1133, ruler of the second power, king Berrik of Lyria, ascended Rivia''s throne creating the first union of both realms. It lasted no longer than a one generation as after his death the kingdoms were inherited by two different heirs.'),

The latter would switch it rulers a couple of times in the subsequent decades, making it disputable between Rivia, Cintra, Temeria and Sodden. Apart from the conflicts there were also arranged marriages with the Temerians: Rivian prince Hugo married Queen Bienvenu of Temeria and the Temerian noble family of Delen intermarried into the main branch of the Rivian dynasty, bringing its ancestral sword into the royal tapestries.'),

In 1259 the throne was ceded to his wife who continued to rule the kingdoms until Northern Wars and longer. In 1268, after the Northern War II, the capital city of Rivia was a place of infamous pogrom against nonhumans.'),
