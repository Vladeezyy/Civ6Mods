Religious tolerance has occurred throughout history, such as in the Achaemenid Empire, the Maurya Empire, and in many parts of today’s world. Towards the end of the Reformation and Wars of Religion period, scholars such as Jean Bodin wished to work toward religious tolerance, and wrote dialogues between interfaith subjects such as The Colloqium of the Seven. Policy adoptions such as the Edict of Torda and Edict of Nantes similarly worked toward the goal of religious tolerance, and the advent of the Enlightenment saw religious coincided with a decrease in religious persecution."),

During the Protestant Reformation, the Reformers insisted that the Lord's Prayer and other forms be memorized in the vernacular languages of the people, rather than in Latin as was the practice among Roman Catholics. They wanted individuals to be able to fully understand the prayers, and lead to Martin Luther using a question and answer format in his 1529 work Small Catechism.

Its show The 700 Club, is one of the oldest on the American television scene and was broadcast in 39 languages in 138 countries in 2016.");
