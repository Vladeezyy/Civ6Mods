This mare, seeing how weak humans are falling prey to dangers, began to nurse them. They fed on her milk until growing strong enough to saddle her, becoming warriors. This is why Ofiri value horses highly and call them "noblest among all beasts".'),

In 1272, they also introduced the mysterious arcana of runewrighting to Nordlings. Ofiris tamed various animals native to their land such as tigers, elephants and eagles. They decorated their animals like their tigers with gold and jewelry. Additionally they shipped war elephants to the Northern Kingdoms so they could fight with them against Nilfgaard.'),

One''s honor can also rise if they undertake a risky task backed by glorious intent. Examples of such are discoveries, explorations or knowledge-expanding. Many Ofiri wear bracelets with runes meant to bring good luck inscribed on them. The king is known to keep several concubines, who wear typical harem outfits, but the current one only calls upon his favorite concubine.'),

His clergy, the Runewrights, believes God speaks through symbols which humans are able to interpret only as imperfect runes, glyphs, and other signs. All magic is said to come from this being. As the cult is pantheistic, its followers view God as both the creator of and the world itself who never ceases to expand. Some faithful go deeper, preferring the term "Universe".'),

Descending from the mountains, one would first enter the thick, primeval forest, only to eventually cross it and reach dry steppes, deserts and barren plateaus of the Continent''s interior. One such plateau is "broken" by a huge canyon up to 3 km deep. The canyon is basically a gigantic oasis hosting a unique microclimate due to its shadow''s cooling effect and multiple sources of freshwater, often in form of waterfalls. All of this makes the growth of rainforest possible and provides habitats for several exotic creatures as well as human settlements.

While humans seem to be prevalent, the national language is at least partially derived from Elder Speech and existence of dwarves and other nonhumans is not unheard of. People are powerfully built, well adapted to harsh environment. Their skin tone ranges from swarthy to black, and their hair from fair to dark. A common practice involves tattoing bodies; each tattoo follows a code, denoting a specific meaning.'),

	'Zerrikania is ruled by a Queen, sometimes also translated as Supreme Leader. By default, the position belongs to the inheriting female clan member of the previous Queen. In instances when the successor refuses assuming the position, or when it is hard to determine who should succeed, the new Leader is chosen through popular vote held during People''s Assembly: a thing-like folkmoot where each free Zerrikanian woman can submit a candidacy and cast a vote.

	'Both CD PROJEKT RED and Netflix took other sources of inspiration in addition to Iranic Scythia. In The Witcher, while Azar Javed bears a Persian name, he is of Arabian or African ethnicity; animals mentioned in game such as tse-tse flies and elephants are characteristic to Africa, whereas the Gardener''s tale about war alludes to experiences of American soldiers during Vietnam War.
