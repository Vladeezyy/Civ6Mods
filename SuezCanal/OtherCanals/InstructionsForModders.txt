So, you want to make your own canal wonder huh?

Well, I've got good and bad news. The good news is that it is possible! The bad news is that there's 
some degree of convolution required.

Turns out that while everything is functional in gameplay terms, the canals built next to the wonder
don't automatically connect to the wonder tile unless the wonder is literally BUILDING_PANAMA_CANAL.

So in order to fix this, I created a system that replaces the asset on top of the canals when
placing the wonder. Make sure to add your own versions of SideCanalDummy_Script (both lua and xml)
as well as your own version of SideCanalDummyGameplayScript.

Aside from that, you need to make sure you have artdef entries in Districts and Landmarks for all
the following districts (these districts dont actually need to exist in the database) :

'DISTRICT_DUMMY_SUEZ_CANAL_BENT_NE',
'DISTRICT_DUMMY_SUEZ_CANAL_BENT_E',	
'DISTRICT_DUMMY_SUEZ_CANAL_BENT_SE'
'DISTRICT_DUMMY_SUEZ_CANAL_BENT_SW'
'DISTRICT_DUMMY_SUEZ_CANAL_BENT_W',
'DISTRICT_DUMMY_SUEZ_CANAL_BENT_NW'

'DISTRICT_DUMMY_SUEZ_CANAL_STRAIGHT_NE'
'DISTRICT_DUMMY_SUEZ_CANAL_STRAIGHT_E'
'DISTRICT_DUMMY_SUEZ_CANAL_STRAIGHT_SE'

Of course, remember to change their names to whatever you need, 
but basically you need an artdef entry for all 6 directions for bent canals, 
and 3 variations for straight ones because we are doing the whole rotation thing manually.

You will of course also need their assets, I have included my own on the mod for reference.
The cool part about this is that you can make the side canals have their own graphic variations
compared to regular canals, helping your wonder look more distinct than Panama.

These dummy district artdefs are also referenced on the lua files, so make sure to replace
the variables there as well.

Have fun canaling!
