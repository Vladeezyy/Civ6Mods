She died c. 1200 BC. The Tomb of Fu Hao was unearthed intact at Yinxu with treasures - known as her 700+ jade objects (Fu Hao was a collector, so some were already antiques), and also her collection of more than 500 bone objects, such as bone oracles (they were from her role as a religious priestess, and were used in her many rituals).'),

The Tu-Fang had fought against the Shang for generations until they were finally defeated by Fu Hao in a single decisive battle. Further campaigns against the neighbouring Yi, Qiang and Ba followed; the latter is particularly remembered for being the earliest recorded large-scale ambush in Chinese history. With up to 13,000 soldiers and important generals Zhi and Hou Gao serving under her, she was the most powerful Shang general of her time.'),

In 378 and 379 he oversaw the replacing of the kings of important Maya states such as Tikal, Uaxactun and Copan with new rulers who claimed descent from Spearthrower Owl. As Fire is Born, he caused himself to be portrayed wearing Teotihuacano battle dress.'),

The appearance of Siyaj K''ak'' marks the beginning of a strong cultural influx from the Valley of Mexico. It is during his lifetime that the public architecture of the Central Mexican capital began to be emulated in the Maya region; particularly the talud-tablero style so characteristic of the Mexican highlands, and so atypical of Maya building styles.');
