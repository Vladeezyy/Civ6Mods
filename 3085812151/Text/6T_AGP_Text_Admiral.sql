During his service under Mentuhotep III, he set out from Coptos at the head of a three-thousand-man strong army, crossed the mountainous Eastern Desert by way of Wadi Hammamat, and went on to the coast of the Red Sea, managing to re-open the trade route to the Land of Punt, bringing exotic treasures back to his homeland. His tomb inscriptions provided an elaborate description of his expeditions, and provided insights for archaeologists to understand the trade and diplomacy of ancient Egypt.'),

This is also the same road that, in the time of the Ptolemies and Romans, led from Coptos in an easterly direction to the harbour of Leucos Limen (now Qossier) on the Red Sea; the great highway and commercial thoroughfare of merchants of all countries, who traded in the wonderful products of Arabia and India; the bridge of the nations, which of old united Asia and Europe.'),

But her three brothers enjoyed fishing more. They would acquire a little knowledge and then rush off to try it out but Nei Manganibuka stuck to her task so that she might quickly learn all her parents could teach her. One day when her brothers and sisters were out, Nei Manganibuka sat aloneâ€”thinking. She decided that she had now learned all she could from her father and mother and that she should kill them before her brothers and sister could acquire the same knowledge.'),

Nei Manganibuka used her navigation skills to leave for a neighboring island, where she married and had three sons. After the first two had died due to inferior navigation knowledge taught by their father''s people, Nei Manganibuka educated her third son, Teraka, herself. Teraka then lead an expedition to Nei Manganibuka''s home island, where the locals had killed his two brothers, not knowing them to be relatives. Using his cunning and the knowledge about navigation and local customs learned from his mother, Teraka survived the traps and helped reunite the family. Seeing Teraka succeed, Nei Manganibuka''s relatives begged her to teach them more of the skills of deep-sea navigation and seamanship.'),
