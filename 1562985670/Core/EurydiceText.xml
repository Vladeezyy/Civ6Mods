			<Text>Eurydice I was the wife of King Amyntas III. She is believed to have been of Lyncestian ancestry, although writers such as Plutarch hold that she was Illyrian. Eurydice, with Amyntas, had three sons - Alexander II, Perdiccas III, and Philip II - all of whom would become King of Macedon. She was also the grandmother of Alexander the Great.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_LEADERS_PAGE_LEADER_SC_EURYDICE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2" Language="en_US">
			<Text>Eurydice was born between 410 and 404 BCE to a noble named Sirras. She married Amyntas in her 20s, probably as a diplomatic attempt to secure peace between Macedon and her people. Amyntas's rule was tumultous; Greek Chalcidians took a large portion of the kingdom, including Pella, until Sparta intervened. Nevertheless, Eurydice was able to supplant Amyntas's primary wife Gygaea to assume the title of Queen. Amyntas III died c. 370 BCE and the kingdom soon began to experience grave troubles. Eurydice's first son, Alexander II took the throne but was killed 2 years later by Ptolemy of Aloros; an agreement worked out by Theban statesman Pelopidas preserved some Macedonian sovereignty, as Ptolemy became regent for Eurydice's two other sons. To protect them, Eurydice married Ptolemy. During Ptolemy's regency for Perdiccas, a noble named Pausanias attempted to usurp the throne. Eurydice asked for help from the Athenian general Iphicrates, who succeeded in driving out Pausanias. Eurydice's bold action likely saved the kingdom and was an extraordinary act for a woman at this time. For this and other reasons, Eurydice's reign is often believed to have marked a turning point in the role of women in Macedon.</Text>

			<Text>Eurydice was very much involved in the affairs of state and the culture of Macedon. She is believed to have funded the construction of a temple dedicated to Eucleia, the female spirit of glory, at Vergina. She is also believed to have learned to read and write late in her life - a talent she believed was a gift of the Muses. The date of her death is unknown, but it is believed to have been between 365 and 359 BCE, meaning that she probably died before seeing her youngest son, Philip II, assume the throne. Philip and his descendants did not forget about Eurydice, however; her portrait-statue was included as part of the Philippeion at Olympia, built to commemorate Philip's victory at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BCE. Though little is solidly known about the life of Eurydice, her valor and bravery outlived her. Aeschines considered her to be a loyal defender of her sons, and Plutarch wrote that she was a model to emulate when educating children.</Text>

			<Text>Eurydice's greatest strengths lie in her relationships with her allies. If you can isolate her diplomatically, her advantages will crumble. Be wary, however, for though she may seem to be more oriented towards defense, Macedonian troops can still pack quite the punch!</Text>

			<Text>As Eurydice, your greatest advantage is unlocked midway through civics tree at Civil Service, which unlocks alliances; unlocking this civic should be a priority for you. Before reaching the medieval era, try to cultivate friendships with nearby civs that you can then elevate into alliances. Also feel free to try and pursue a religion in the early game; with the bonus science from Holy Site buildings, focusing on early religion won't be as punishing for you as it might be for other leaders.</Text>
